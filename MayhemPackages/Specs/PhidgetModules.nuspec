	Phidgets are a set of "plug and play" building blocks for low cost USB sensing and control from your PC. You can learn more about Phidgets at:

http://www.phidgets.com/

Most Phidgets sensors plug into an I/O board, which then connects to the PC via a single USB cable.

The currently supported I/O board is the 1018_2 PhidgetInterfaceKit 8/8/8:

Currently, only one interface kit may be used at a time. Because Phidgets do not self-report, you must specify which port a sensor is connected to.


Event

The Phidgets event includes using the digital inputs on the I/O board, as well as the following sensors:

1106_0 - Force Sensor	http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=3&amp;product_id=1106_0
1101_0 - IR Distance Adapter	http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=2&amp;product_id=1101_0	with a 3522_0 - Sharp Distance Sensor 2Y0A02 (20-150cm)	http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?product_id=3522
1127_0 - Precision Light Sensor http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=6&amp;product_id=1127_0
1103_1 - IR Reflective Sensor 10cm	http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=2&amp;product_id=1103_1	
1133_0 - Sound Sensor	http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=6&amp;product_id=1133_0
1129_0 - Touch Sensor	http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=4&amp;product_id=1129_0

In addition to these, there is one sensor with its own USB port which is supported:

1045_0 - PhidgetTemperatureSensor IR http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=6&amp;product_id=1045_0


Reactions

There are two Phidgets reactions:

Setting the level of a digital output on the I/O board

Driving a servo motor to a specified position using a:

1066_0 - PhidgetAdvancedServo 1-Motor	http://www.phidgets.com/products.php?category=11&amp;product_id=1066_0  used with an appropriate servo motor (&lt;450mA – see the Phidgets site for details))

Note: this board has a separate USB connection, and does not use an I/O board. Currently, only one servo controller can be used at a time.
