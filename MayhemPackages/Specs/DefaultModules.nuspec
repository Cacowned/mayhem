    <description>These are the default modules for Mayhem. These basic events and reactions work without additional hardware or software.
Events
Folder Change – Triggers when the filenames or number of files in the specified folder is changed. This includes an option to check subfolders.
Keypress – Triggers when the specified key or key combination is pressed. This works transparently in the background, independent of which application is in the foreground.
Timer – Triggers repeatedly at the specified interval.
System Tray Menu - This allows a user to manually trigger an event from a Mayhem icon in the System Tray. Multiple System Tray Menu events can be running simultaneously, and the user can select among them from a list via the single Mayhem icon.


Reactions
Lock Workstation – Puts the computer into the Windows lock state
Media controls – Sends the Media Next Item, Play/Pause or Previous Item command to all open Windows on your computer. This works with Windows Media Player, iTunes, VLC, or any other player which takes standard input.
Open Website – Opens your default browser to the specified URL.
Play Sound – Plays a sound file. It supports wav, wma, and mp3 format.
Run Program – Equivalent to the Run command. Can be used to launch files or programs.
Screenshot – Takes a picture of the entire desktop and saves it to the specified folder in jpg format. Pictures will be named with the time the picture was taken.
Text to Speech – Speaks the specified text using a synthesized voice.</description>
